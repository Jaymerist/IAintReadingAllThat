                <p>This extension was made during HackED Beta 2023. Which is an annual Hackathon hosted at the
                    University of Alberta.</p>

                <h2>Why did we make this?</h2>
                <p>Don't you hate it when you have to read a long bloated article for an assignment? or just want to
                    catch up with the times without wasting all of yours? We do too, so we created this extension to
                    summarize articles and give you news based directly on your interests.</p>
