HackED Beta 2023 Project

Team Members: Mihiri Kamiss, Jaxon Gosche, Reo Duque, Alex Twin

This is an unfinished project for HackED Beta 2023. The goal of the project was to create a google chrome news widget that summarized daily news to the user using OpenAI's API and News API. We could not move forward with the project after discovering the limitations and costs of the APIs involved.
